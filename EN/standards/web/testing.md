# Web Testing Standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Test early and test often
- Automate tests wherever possible
- Test at appropriate levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Write maintainable and reliable tests
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Use testing to prevent regressions
- Prioritize tests based on business impact
- Treat test code with the same care as production code

## Test Types & Coverage

### Unit Testing

- **Target**: Individual functions, components, and modules
- **Coverage Goal**: 80%+ of business logic and utilities
- **Tools**: Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Best Practices**:
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - One assertion per test when possible
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Test edge cases and error conditions
  - Keep tests fast (< 100ms per test)
  - Use descriptive test names
  - Isolate tests from each other

### Integration Testing

- **Target**: Interactions between components and services
- **Coverage Goal**: Critical user flows and component interactions
- **Tools**: React Testing Library, MSW, Supertest
- **Best Practices**:
  - Test component compositions
  - Test form submissions
  - Mock API responses
  - Test state changes
  - Verify DOM updates
  - Test routing and navigation
  - Use realistic test data

### End-to-End Testing

- **Target**: Complete user flows from UI to backend
- **Coverage Goal**: Critical business paths and user journeys
- **Tools**: Cypress, Playwright
- **Best Practices**:
  - Focus on critical user journeys
  - Test on multiple browsers
  - Use stable selectors (data-testid)
  - Set up isolated test environments
  - Manage test data effectively
  - Take screenshots on failures
  - Implement retry logic for flaky tests

### Visual Regression Testing

- **Target**: UI appearance and layout
- **Coverage Goal**: Key UI components and pages
- **Tools**: Percy, Chromatic, Playwright
- **Best Practices**:
  - Capture baseline screenshots
  - Test across different viewports
  - Ignore dynamic content
  - Review visual changes carefully
  - Test light/dark modes
  - Test with different content lengths
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

### Accessibility Testing

- **Target**: WCAG compliance and accessibility issues
- **Coverage Goal**: All user-facing components and pages
- **Tools**: axe, Lighthouse, WAVE
- **Best Practices**:
  - Test keyboard navigation
  - Verify screen reader compatibility
  - Check color contrast
  - Test focus management
  - Verify ARIA attributes
  - Test with assistive technologies
  - Automate basic accessibility checks

### Performance Testing

- **Target**: Page load times, rendering performance
- **Coverage Goal**: Key pages and critical user paths
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, k6
- **Best Practices**:
  - Measure Core Web Vitals
  - Test on low-end devices
  - Simulate network throttling
  - Monitor bundle size
  - Test with realistic caching scenarios
  - Measure time to interactive
  - Set performance budgets

## Testing Practices

### Test Organization

- Group tests logically by feature or component
- Use descriptive file names and test descriptions
- Separate test utilities and fixtures
- Organize tests in a hierarchy that mirrors the codebase
- Keep test files close to the code they test
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Separate unit, integration, and e2e tests

### Test Data Management

- Use factories or builders for test data
- Avoid hardcoded test data
- Use realistic data that matches production patterns
- Reset test state between tests
- Isolate test environments
- Consider data privacy in test data
- Use seeded random data for edge cases

### Mocking & Stubbing

- Mock external dependencies (APIs, services)
- Use realistic mock responses
- Reset mocks between tests
- Avoid excessive mocking
- Mock at the appropriate level
- Document mock behavior
- Use MSW for API mocking

### Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Implement parallel test execution
- Set up test reporting and dashboards
- Configure test failure notifications
- Implement test retries for flaky tests
- Cache test dependencies
- Run different test types at appropriate stages

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Write tests before implementing features
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Start with simple test cases
- Incrementally add complexity
- Use tests to drive design
- Refactor tests as code evolves
- Focus on behavior, not implementation

## Test Maintenance

- Regularly review and update tests
- Remove or fix flaky tests
- Refactor tests with code changes
- Monitor test performance
- Analyze test coverage regularly
- Document testing strategy
- Train team members on testing practices

## Specialized Testing

### API Testing

- Test all API endpoints
- Verify request/response schemas
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test error handling and status codes
- Validate business logic
- Test rate limiting and quotas
- Document API test cases

### State Management Testing

- Test state transitions
- Verify initial state
- Test reducers and actions
- Test selectors and derived state
- Mock external dependencies
- Test asynchronous state changes
- Verify state persistence

### Form Testing

- Test form submissions
- Validate form inputs
- Test error states
- Test form reset functionality
- Test conditional form logic
- Verify accessibility of form elements
- Test form with keyboard navigation

### Security Testing

- Test authentication flows
- Verify authorization checks
- Test against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Validate input sanitization
- Test file upload security
- Verify secure headers
- Test against OWASP Top 10
