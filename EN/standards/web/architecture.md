# Web Architecture Standards

## Core Principles

- Modular and scalable architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- SOLID and DRY principles
- Consistent folder structure
- Documented architecture with diagrams
- Component-based design

## Recommended Architectures

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component Architecture**
  - Atomic Design methodology
  - Smart vs. Presentational components
  - Composition over inheritance
  - Component libraries and design systems

- **State Management**
  - Centralized state for application-wide data
  - Local state for component-specific data
  - Server state for API data
  - Context API for theme/auth/localization

- **Data Flow**
  - Unidirectional data flow
  - Immutable state updates
  - Event-driven communication
  - Pub/sub patterns for cross-component communication

### Application Architecture

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**
  - For highly interactive applications
  - Single Page Application (SPA) model
  - Client-side routing

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
  - For SEO-critical applications
  - Improved initial load performance
  - Better accessibility and SEO

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
  - For content-focused websites
  - Pre-rendered HTML
  - Minimal JavaScript requirements

- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
  - For dynamic content with static benefits
  - Background regeneration
  - Stale-while-revalidate pattern

- **Islands Architecture**
  - For mostly static sites with interactive components
  - Hydration of specific components
  - Reduced JavaScript payload

## Project Structure

```

├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── atoms/        # Basic building blocks
│   ├── molecules/    # Groups of atoms
│   ├── organisms/    # Groups of molecules
│   └── templates/    # Page layouts

└── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Best Practices

- Group files by feature/module
- Maintain clear boundaries between modules
- Keep configuration files at the root
- Implement optimized state management
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use lazy loading for code splitting
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Recommended Frameworks

- **Next.js** - For SSR, SSG, and ISR applications
- **React** - For component-based UIs
- **Vue.js** - Alternative to React with simpler learning curve
- **Astro** - For content-focused websites with minimal JS
- **Remix** - For full-stack web applications
- **SvelteKit** - For high-performance applications
