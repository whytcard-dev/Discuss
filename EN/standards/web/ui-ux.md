# UI/UX Design Standards

## Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Maintain visual and functional consistency across the site
- **Clarity**: Design clear interfaces that minimize cognitive load
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for all user interactions
- **Efficiency**: Minimize steps to complete tasks
- **Forgiveness**: Allow users to undo actions and recover from errors
- **Accessibility**: Design for users of all abilities
- **Simplicity**: Keep interfaces simple and intuitive

## Visual Design

### Color System

- Define a primary, secondary, and accent color palette
- Include semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Define color variables for light and dark modes
- Limit color palette to 5-7 core colors with variations
- Document color usage guidelines and meaning
- Test colors for color blindness accessibility

### Typography

- Select a primary font for UI and a secondary font for content (if needed)
- Define a clear type scale with limited sizes (e.g., 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48px)
- Maintain proper line height (1.4-1.6 for body text)
- Ensure minimum font size of 16px for body text
- Define font weights (regular, medium, bold)
- Set appropriate letter spacing
- Ensure text remains readable on all backgrounds
- Use relative units (rem/em) instead of pixels

### Spacing & Layout

- Create a consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Implement consistent padding and margins
- Use grid systems for alignment and structure
- Maintain proper white space for readability
- Define standard component spacing
- Ensure proper content hierarchy
- Implement responsive layout patterns

### Imagery & Icons

- Use consistent icon style and size
- Ensure icons are recognizable and meaningful
- Provide text alternatives for icons
- Optimize images for performance
- Implement responsive images
- Maintain consistent image aspect ratios
- Use SVG for icons and simple illustrations

## Components & Patterns

### Component Library

- Build a comprehensive component library
- Document component usage and variations
- Ensure components are accessible
- Create responsive components
- Define component states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled)
- Implement consistent animation patterns
- Create reusable patterns for common UI needs

### Navigation

- Implement clear and consistent navigation
- Provide visual indicators for current location
- Ensure navigation is keyboard accessible
- Make navigation items descriptive
- Limit primary navigation to 7±2 items
- Provide secondary navigation for complex sites
- Implement breadcrumbs for deep navigation structures

### Forms

- Group related form fields
- Provide clear labels for all form fields
- Show validation errors inline
- Indicate required fields
- Use appropriate input types
- Implement logical tab order
- Show helpful error messages
- Provide success confirmation
- Maintain state during form submission errors

### Content

- Create scannable content with clear headings
- Use bulleted lists for multiple items
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 lines)
- Use meaningful subheadings
- Implement proper content hierarchy
- Ensure readability (Flesch reading score)
- Use plain language (avoid jargon)

## Interaction Design

### Micro-interactions

- Design subtle, purposeful animations
- Keep animations under 300ms for UI feedback
- Provide visual feedback for all interactions
- Ensure animations don't interfere with usability
- Implement consistent transition patterns
- Use animation to guide attention
- Respect reduced motion preferences

### States & Feedback

- Design all interactive element states:
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Focus
  - Active
  - Disabled
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Show system status clearly
- Use appropriate loading indicators
- Implement error states that guide resolution
- Design empty states for lists and data displays

### Mobile & Touch

- Design for touch targets (minimum 44×44px)
- Account for thumb zones on mobile devices
- Implement gesture-based interactions consistently
- Avoid hover-dependent interactions on mobile
- Design for both portrait and landscape orientations
- Ensure tap targets have sufficient spacing
- Optimize for one-handed use when possible

## User Experience

### Usability Principles

- Follow recognized design patterns
- Minimize cognitive load
- Make important actions obvious
- Provide clear calls-to-action
- Design predictable interfaces
- Prioritize content by importance
- Eliminate unnecessary complexity

### Responsive Design

- Implement mobile-first design approach
- Define standard breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- Adapt layouts appropriately for each breakpoint
- Ensure touch-friendly interfaces on mobile
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Consider device capabilities and limitations
- Optimize performance for mobile networks

### Accessibility (WCAG)

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum
- Ensure keyboard navigability
- Provide sufficient color contrast
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Create accessible forms
- Test with screen readers
- Support text resizing up to 200%
- Implement focus indicators
- Provide alternative text for images
- Create accessible data tables

## Research & Testing

### User Research

- Conduct user interviews and surveys
- Create evidence-based personas
- Map user journeys
- Identify pain points and opportunities
- Validate assumptions with real users
- Use analytics to inform design decisions
- Implement continuous feedback mechanisms

### Usability Testing

- Test designs with representative users
- Conduct both moderated and unmoderated tests
- Test across different devices and browsers
- Measure task completion rates
- Collect qualitative feedback
- Iterate based on test results
- Test with assistive technologies
